- Matching solely base on appearance
- No intellegent way to improve matching result
- Doing nothing to help users to sustain the relationship

# How it works
To match a new partner, it requires two criterias: hobbies and languages. A number of hobbies are provided in the selection table. Users can select their interested field in a scale of 1 to 5. In addition, users also have to provide their native language and target language (i.e. language that they would like to learn). 

Then the matching system will match the suitable buddy for the user according to their hobby selection as well as their language perferance. Apart from exchanging experience in their common interest fields, language improvement can be also achieved through the conversation among native language users. And language exchange is the primary way for users to sustain their relationship.
